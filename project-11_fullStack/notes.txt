* Install Express = sudo npm install --save Express
Node = Javascript runtime used to execute code outside of the browser
Express = Library that runs in the Node runtime. Has helpers to make dealing with HTTP traffic easier.

* create root file index.js
* Does not use the 'import express from 'express';' as React does.
    * It is called the ES2015 Module that express does not currently support.

Heroku = https://git.heroku.com/agile-depths-93200.git

Google:
- Client ID = 
- Client Secret = 


* When there are changes to the index.js or any other files, update the new code to heroku.
1. git add -A
2. git commit -m "change made goes here"
3. git push heroku master
    - this is the new code pushed to heroku
4. check for error using 'heroku logs' at terminal
5. Run new code with 'heroku start'
